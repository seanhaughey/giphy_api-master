# Hamster Time!

It's time to write a simple program that opens a wonderful hamster GIF in your browser!

* Start by running `npm install`.
* Next, find the correct endpoint in the [Giphy API Documentation](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI). You'll want to utilize the Search Endpoint and the public beta API key.
* Once you complete step 1 in the code, you can run the program via `node hamster.js`.
* Complete steps 2-5 in the code. There are code snippets commented out throughout – uncomment them and replace the question marks!
